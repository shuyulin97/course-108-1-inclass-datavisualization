This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
df_taoyuanMarriage_gather %>%
  group_by(月份)%>%
  summarise(總對數 = sum(對數))

df_spreadExample <- data.frame(
  id = c(1,1,1,2,2,2),
  var = c("花朶萼片長度", "學名", "總類數"),
  value = c(5.1, "setosa", 1, 
            7.0, "versicolor", 2))
